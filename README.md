# The Hidden Crisis in Male Mental Health


Overview
This project explores the **treatment gap in male mental health** across U.S. states using publicly available data.  
While mental illness affects both men and women, men are **consistently less likely to receive treatment**.  

Through data cleaning, analysis, and visualization, this project highlights:
- How many adults live with mental disorders by state  
- How many receive treatment  
- Where men are most underserved compared to women  

The aim is to raise awareness of the hidden crisis in male mental health and demonstrate data storytelling through visual analytics.

Key Findings
- In states like Hawaii, New Mexico, and Texas, men have some of the lowest treatment rates.
- In contrast, Vermont and Minnesota show some of the highest rates of men receiving care.
- 41.6% of men with a mental illness receive treatment compared to 56.9% of women.
- In some states, treatment received exceeds reported prevalence (possible over-reporting or cross-treatment of non-diagnosed individuals).
